What is GLGE?

GLGE is a javascript library intended to ease the use of WebGL; which is 
basically a native browser javascript API giving direct access to openGL 
ES2, allowing for the use of hardware accelerated 2D/3D applications 
without having to download any plugins.

The aim of GLGE is to mask the involved nature of WebGL from the web 
developer, who can then spend his/her time creating richer content for 
the web.
