SAGE - as an acronym for Simple and Adaptative Graphic Engine - is a lightweight JavaScript 
graphic engine that allows "non-enlightened-to-3D" developers (most known as Web Developers) 
to embed rich 3D scenes all over the Internet.
Built on an Open Source architecture, it offers additional modules support and provides 
a community shared repository.


First thing to know: SAGE is not the CryEngine, nor the Unreal Engine; and he doesn't want to.
The main goal is to provide a never seen level of simplicity in 3D gesture so every 
developer can finally create and manipulate a 3D environment with no theorical knowledge.

The Second thing to know about SAGE is that it is not a Game Engine.
Of course it can be used to produce Games but it doesn't offer highly specific
functionalities like physics or artificial intelligence.
That being said, and since 3D is not limited to Gaming, SAGE can be used to develop simple and 
addictive games, advanced web apps or powerful office tools.
